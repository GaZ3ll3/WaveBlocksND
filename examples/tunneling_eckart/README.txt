The Eckart tunneling examples are taken from the paper:

@article{GHJ_tunneling_spawning,
        author = {Vasile Gradinaru and George A. Hagedorn and Alain Joye},
	title = {Tunneling dynamics and spawning with adaptive semiclassical wave packets},
	journal = {The Journal of Chemical Physics},
	volume = {132},
	number = {18},
	publisher = {AIP},
	year = {2010},
	doi = {10.1063/1.3429607}
}

Note that there is a misprint in the initial values for Q(0) and P(0).
The values should be Q(0) = 1 / sqrt(2 * 0.04) and P(0) = i * sqrt(2 * 0.04).

The data for the model potential come from:

@article {PA_tddvr,
	 author = {Puzari, Panchanan and Adhikari, Satrajit},
	 title = {Semi-classical formulation of time-dependent discrete variable representation method},
	 journal = {International Journal of Quantum Chemistry},
	 volume = {98},
	 number = {5},
